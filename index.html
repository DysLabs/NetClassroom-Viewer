      <hr/>
      <p>NetClassroom is an awful website my school uses for grade-keeping. One of the major problems I've had with it is that it doesn't tell you your GPA until report cards are sent out. This can login to your account, view your grades, and then calculate your GPA. I might think of making this more functional later, but for now its a command-line Scala program that prompts for your username and password.</p>

      <p>It is dependent on <a href="http://htmlunit.sourceforge.net/">HTMLUnit</a>.</p>

      <p>This was also my first time programming with Scala so that's also a disaster.</p>
